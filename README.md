If you do not   participate   in the course, you will   be counted   absent.   Simply   logging   in   is   not   enough; you must submit/complete an assignment,   post to a   discussion   board,   or   other   similar assignment tasks to avoid being counted absent.   Instructors   are   required   to   submit   attendance the   Monday following each week of class.
This attendance is   reported to the   Financial Aid   Department and   may   result   in the   loss of   any financial aid   refund you are expecting   if you   have not been   participating   in your   courses.   In addition, you will   be administratively dropped from the course   if you are   reported absent a total of three weeks.
Please note that completing the following actions will   not count   as   present for this   class:
•          Logging   into   Moodle
•          Reviewing Course   Materials
•         Any email or phone contact with   the   instructor
•         Submitting work early. One assignment must be   submitted   during   each week   to   be counted   present.
Late   Policy:   Late work will   not   be accepted.   However,   in exceptional situations and with   proper official documentation (doctor’s   note, police   report, etc.) an   extension   may   be granted.
Grading/Evaluation:
The   undergraduate course grading scale   is as follows:
